ok so have auth business logic in the auth store
for the auth store use the setup Store not the options store, its the recommended and more flexible API.
keep the request logic seperetted and use that in the store actions themselves, they should be cleanely able to be async.
have the login, create acc, etc methods return result objects, with error messages and success and what not.

prevent login attempt if loading, either with spinning circle, is true or just block input edits or at least the input button
